Task 3: Answer the Guide Questions

What is the difference between readyState and status in XMLHttpRequest?
	-	The readyState shows the current stage of the request process, while the status shows the server’s response code that indicates whether the request was successful or not.

How can you make the request asynchronous?
	-	You can make the request asynchronous by setting the third parameter of the .open() method to true, like this: xhr.open("GET", url, true);.

Why is asynchronous communication recommended for web applications?
	-	Asynchronous communication is recommended because it allows the webpage to stay responsive and continue running other tasks while waiting for the server’s response, improving user experience.
